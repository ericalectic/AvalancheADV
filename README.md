## Overview

This repository contains two Solidity smart contracts: `ERC20.sol` and `Vault.sol`. These contracts implement an ERC-20 token and a corresponding vault to manage deposits and withdrawals.

### ERC20.sol

- **Name**: Solidity by Example
- **Symbol**: SOLBYEX
- **Decimals**: 18

This ERC-20 token contract includes standard functions such as `transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom`, `mint`, and `burn`. It emits events for `Transfer` and `Approval`.

### Vault.sol

The `Vault` contract interacts with an ERC-20 token (assumed to be Solidity by Example) and implements deposit and withdrawal functionalities. It calculates shares based on the deposited amount and manages the total supply of shares.

## Usage

### ERC20.sol

1. **Transfer Tokens:**
2. **Mint Tokens:**
3. **Burn Tokens:**
